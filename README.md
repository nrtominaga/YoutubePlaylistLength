# YoutubePlaylistLength

This is a small little project I did to teach myself some python.  It calculates the total amount of time a youtube playlist is and coverts into hours minutes and seconds.  I used the Youtube v3 data API to retrieve all the information needed.

I had an API key that was committed to this repo that I've deleted.  A new API key has been generated and can only be accessed locally.
